    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a **self-contained notebook** - everything you need is here!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quick Start\n",
    "1. **Run all cells** up to Section 5 (this loads the game client)\n",
    "2. **Implement your solver** in Section 5\n",
    "3. **Update configuration** in Section 7\n",
    "4. **Play the game** in Section 7\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You Need To Do\n",
    "- Focus ONLY on implementing `my_agent()` function (Section 5)\n",
    "- You can create various players, you'll be able to select your preferred one\n",
    "- Everything else is provided for you!\n",
    "\n",
    "### About Ghosts\n",
    "Ghosts is a 2-player bluffing/deduction board game where:\n",
    "- 6x6 board with exits at the four corners\n",
    "- Each player has 8 ghosts: 4 good (blue) and 4 evil (red)\n",
    "- Ghosts are hidden - opponents can't see which type until captured\n",
    "- Players arrange their ghosts at the start in two rows (columns 1-4 only)\n",
    "- Goal: Either (1) capture all opponent's good ghosts, OR (2) get a good ghost to an exit on opponent's side\n",
    "- Lose if: (1) all your good ghosts are captured, OR (2) you capture all opponent's evil ghosts\n",
    "- Movement: One square orthogonally (up, down, left, right)\n",
    "- Capture: Move onto opponent's ghost to capture it (reveals both ghosts' types)"
